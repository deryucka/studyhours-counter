# Study Hours Counter

A simple counter to track study hours: increment the count and save entries while the page is open.

## Live Demo

(Add link here if you have one)

## Overview

This project is a small front-end exercise to practice basic interaction and simple UI feedback.  
You can increment your study hours and save the current value. When the page is refreshed, the count resets.

## What you can do

- Increase the counter (increment)
- Save the current number as a record/log
- Start over automatically on refresh

## Tech

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Notes

This is intentionally simple. A future improvement would be saving data in the browser (so saved hours remain after refresh).
